game extraction

- queue of positions to start reading from
- when a string operation is found, interpret its argument as a string
    - store strings separately
    - store the positions where string pointers are and run through them after everything, also adding an arg annotation
    - append strings to game data
    - extract .bin
- something similar with tickflow pointers
    - except the tickflow at those positions also has to be extracted -> add to queue
- engine switching
    - mainly so i can keep track of if the command is string pointer or not
- detecting when to return
    - if/switch commands add "depth", while the end commands remove it
    - if depth <= 0 and return/stop are found, end
