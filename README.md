# Deckompiler
A tool for use with Tickompiler's binary formats.

**API UNSTABLE AND BOUND TO CHANGE**

### Grab yourself a build
Don't think I'll make a stable release for a looong time, if ever, so just fetch yourself a build from the Actions tab or (https://nightly.link/patataofcourse/Deckompiler/workflows/debug/master).

**NO PREMADE BUILDS ARE OFFERED FOR A CERTAIN OTHER BINARY.** Build it yourself or ask someone who has to use it for you.
